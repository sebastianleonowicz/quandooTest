# Chosen technologies:

- create-react-app npm package - Makes setting up a react project much faster.

- React - Has been chosen for rendering the the fetched data. I'm currently learning react and came to the conclusion that it's a good opportunity to learn

- Styled Components - Chosen because of the ability to use the scss-like syntax in order to style components. 

- Axios - Chosen because Fetch would not be working for browsers such as IE.

# In order to run:

- npm install

- npm run start - website should be available on port 3000
